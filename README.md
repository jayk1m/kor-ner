### Comparison of Different NER Models for Korean
We plan to try, compare, analyze, and hopefully provide some insights into improving various models for performing named-entity recognition (NER) in the Korean language, possibly using the NER Corpus provided by the National Institute of Korean Language (ROK). Not surprisingly, the language has manifested nontrivial challenges for such task in the recent years. First of all, the way by which Korean words can be identified (via spacing, etc.) is quite different from that for English, meaning even word segmentation can be an issue at hand. More importantly, the lack of uppercase letters as well as different ways to format nouns, pronouns, and proper nouns should be taken into consideration. Some models we plan to utilize include HMM, MEMM, CRF, kNN, DT, RF, and ConvNet.
